LOV-ES: Guiding the ontology selection to structure textual data using topic modeling
=====================================================================================

> Guessing potential RDF vocabularies from natural language texts
  using LDA


Abstract
--------

On-line availability of text corpora nowadays allow data practitioners
to build complex knowledge combining various sources. One common
shared challenge lays in the modelisation of intermediate knowledge
structures able to gather at once the various topics present in the
texts. Practically, practitioners often go through the creation of
vocabularies. In order to help these domain experts, we design LOV-ES:
a solution able to help them in this creative process, guiding them in
the selection and the combination of already existing vocabularies
available online. Technically, our solution relies on LDA to detect
topics and on the LOV to then propose candidate vocabularies.
